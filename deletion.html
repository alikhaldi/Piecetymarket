    <h1>Account Deletion Policy</h1>
    <p>At PiecetyMarket, you have full control over your personal data. If you wish to delete your account, here is how it works:</p>

    <h2>1. Request Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can request deletion of your account by contacting support at <a href="mailto:support@piecetymarket.com">support@piecetymarket.com</a> or through the account settings page.</p>

    <h2>2. What Happens After Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your account information and personal data will be permanently removed.</li>
      <li>Your listings will be unpublished and no longer visible to other users.</li>
      <li>Certain transactional data (such as completed sales) may be retained if required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Timeline</h2>
    <p>We will process deletion requests within 30 days, unless a legal requirement prevents us from doing so immediately.</p>

    <h2>4. Reactivation</h2>
    <p>Once deleted, your account cannot be reactivated. You will need to create a new account if you return to PiecetyMarket.</p>
